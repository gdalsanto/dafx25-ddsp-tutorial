## Building Flexible Audio DDSP Pipelines: A Case Study on Artificial Reverb
### Gloria Dal Santo, International Conference on Digital Audio Effects, 2025
#### Ancona, Italy, 2 - 5 September 2025

This repository contains code demonstrations presented during the tutorial.  
This code uses the [FLAMO](https://github.com/gdalsanto/flamo) library to implement and train the differentiable feedback delay network (FDN) for artificial reverberation. 
The slides are [here](data/DAFx25_tutorial.pdf).
